## The short story

This tool gives an insight into the version of English (US or UK) Bluesky posters are using.

This was a weekend project I ([@stu.pocknee.com](https://bsky.app/profile/stu.pocknee.com)) undertook to try out the BlueSky Firehose API.

It was inspired by (potentially NSFW) efforts such as:

* [RainbowSky](https://www.bewitched.com/demo/rainbowsky)
* [EmojiRain](https://www.emojirain.lol)
* [Into the Bluesky](https://www.intothebluesky.lol)
* [Bluesky Visualizers](https://flo-bit.dev/bluesky-visualizers)
* [Firehose 3D](https://firehose3d.theo.io)
* [SwearSky](https://swearsky.bagpuss.org) (NSFW)
* [I am...](https://javier.computer/bluesky/iam)
* [Firesky](https://firesky.tv)
* [Bluesky Mosaic](https://lantto.github.io/bluesky-mosaic) (NSFW)
* [Bluesky Signups](https://bluesky.toddle.site/signups)

Bluesky posts are ingested in real-time and compared against a catalog(ue) of word tuplets with both UK and US spellings.

There is no claim that my self-compiled word list is complete. My comparison method is quick, dirty, and periodically wrong. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
